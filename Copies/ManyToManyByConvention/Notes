//Section 14 when I added the ICollection to the Domain to do a migration I wrote --> dotnet ef migrations add ActivityAttendee -p Persistence -s API

However this is not good because, yes if I look at the migrations in the Persistence i see:


using System;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Migrations;

namespace Persistence.Migrations
{
    public partial class ActivityAttendee : Migration
    {
        protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
        {
            migrationBuilder.CreateTable(
                name: "ActivityAppUser",
                columns: table => new
                {
                    ActivitiesId = table.Column<Guid>(type: "TEXT", nullable: false),
                    AttendeesId = table.Column<string>(type: "TEXT", nullable: false)
                },
                constraints: table =>
                {
                    table.PrimaryKey("PK_ActivityAppUser", x => new { x.ActivitiesId, x.AttendeesId });
                    table.ForeignKey(
                        name: "FK_ActivityAppUser_Activities_ActivitiesId",
     ...

He created a table of both keys which is good, However by convention I cannot add any new column to this table and I want to add date and isHost but i cannot do that 
so i will remove the migration and do it manually 
so to remove it i write:
dotnet ef migrations remove -p Persistence -s API
